# Hi, I'm Umesh! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a data scientist with a strong background in data analysis and machine learning. My expertise lies in effectively harnessing and analyzing data to derive valuable insights. I have a proven track record of applying advanced statistical and machine-learning techniques to tackle complex data challenges, especially time series. My experience includes developing predictive models, identifying patterns, and extracting meaningful information from diverse datasets. I am dedicated to utilizing my skills to drive data-driven decision-making and contribute to the field of data science.

# Time Series EDA techniques 

This project includes many Exploratory Data Analysis techniques on the Time Series data.

This is a high-performance and clear visualization of Python implementation with Time Series techniques, which includes a wide variety of testing using statistical analysis and libraries. Results are stored 1. In document file 2. In CSV file 


### Goals
ðŸ’¡ Learning: Learn various time series EDA techniques that help in non-time series data as well

ðŸ’» Hardware support: Full! seamless support for every system

ðŸ”‹ Try with your own: Take any forecast/demand data and make use of it to get useful insights out of it 

### Techniques includes
```
1. Summary of data (Number of products, Range of quantity, Min/Max quantity of product, etc.)
2. ABC analysis (plot volume data)
3. Missing value
4. Skewed products
5. Creating time series features
6. Aggregate plotting
7. Zscore outlier
8. XYZ data segmentation
9. ABC-XYZ
10. COV
11. Correlation plot between quantity and time features
12. Negative sales
13. Heteroscedasticity
14. Leading zeros sales
15. Time series feature extraction
	1. Trend
	2. Seasonal
16. Clustering for similar products
17. Entropy
18. Trend line change
19. Stationarity test
20. Level Shift
21. Outlier in last 1 year
22. Number of zeros
23. Repeatitative values
24. Flat/Constant sales
25. Intermittency
```

## Getting Started
Follow the below instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo: Clone it on your suitable project path
git clone https://github.com/Umesh92x/ExploratoryDataAnalysis.git

### Execution 

#### Step 1
Once cloned; it contains
1. Config file : A ConfigEDA.ini file
2. Ipynp file : Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb
3. Sample CSV file : SampleSalesData.csv
4. Output CSV file and screenshots

#### Step 2

1. Open the config .ini file and add the path and file name. Leave other fields as it is
2. Opne the Notebook
3. Run the Notebook via the 'Re-run whole notebook' option
4. It may take 3-4 mins with Any CPU and RAM. Time computation can be viewed in the output doc file (Output folder)
